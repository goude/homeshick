homeshick
=========
homeshick keeps your dotfiles up to date using only git and bash.
It can handle many dotfile repositories at once, so you can beef up your own dotfiles
with bigger projects like [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and still
keep everything organized.

homeshick is installed to your own home directory and does not require root privileges to be installed.
For [installation instructions](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick/wiki/Installation), [tutorials](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick/wiki/Tutorials) and [tips](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick/wiki/Automatic-deployment) & [tricks](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick/wiki/Symlinking) have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick/wiki).
